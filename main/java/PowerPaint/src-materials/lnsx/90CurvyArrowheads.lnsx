		You may notice the similarity to the SVG path element syntax.
		You may be tempted to copypasta SVG paths into here.
		Before doing so, keep in mind the following caveats:
		  * Repeated instructions cannot be omitted:
		        "L 1 2 L 3 4" is valid here;
		        "L 1 2 3 4" is NOT valid here.
		You may be tempted to copypasta paths from here into SVG.
		Before doing so, keep in mind the following caveats:
		  * There are three instructions supported here but not in SVG:
		        G x1 y1 x2 y2
		            Draws the circular arc starting at the current point,
		            ending at x2,y2, and containing x1,y1. The current point
		            becomes x2,y2.
		        R x y w h rx ry
		            Draws a rectangle with upper-left corner x,y, width w,
		            height h, and rounded corners of radius rx,ry, without
		            changing the current point. If rx = 0 or ry = 0, draws
		            a rectangle without rounded corners.
		        E x y w h start extent type
		            Draws an arc of an ellipse bounded by the rectangle with
		            upper-left corner x,y, width w, and height h, starting at
		            angle (start) and ending at angle (start+extent), without
		            changing the current point. Type is 0 for an arc with
		            disconnected endpoints, 1 for an arc with connected
		            endpoints, or 2 for a pie slice. If abs(extent) >= 360,
		            draws a full ellipse.
